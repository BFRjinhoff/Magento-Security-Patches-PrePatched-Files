<strong>Note:</strong> Magento was recently informed about an issue with both patch SUPEE-10570 and Magento versions 1.9.3.8/1.14.3.8 that could result in the inability of customers to complete checkout when trying to register during checkout. Magento is now providing an updated patch (SUPEE-10570v2) that no longer causes this issue. Note, however, that this new patch no longer protects against two low risk session handling-related security issues that patch SUPEE-10570 protected against.

If you have not yet applied SUPEE-10570v1, do not apply it, but instead patch your store with SUPEE-10570v2. If you have already applied SUPEE-10570v1, please first uninstall SUPEE-10570v1, then install SUPEE-10570v2. All stores should be patched with SUPEE-10570v2 as Magento will use this patch as a base for future patch versions. [Source](https://magento.com/security/patches/supee-10570)
